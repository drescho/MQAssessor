WHAT IS THIS?
==========
The MQAssessor calculates several indicators that can be used to assess the discriminant validity and reliability of measurements.\
Social science researchers routinely report the discriminant validity and reliability of their measurements. However, existing structural equation modeling software does not automatically provide related values, so users had to calculate them manually. This is cumbersome, takes a long time, and produces many errors. MQAssessor is software that automates this process. MQAssessor is not finalized and will be explained in full in the working paper "Discrminant validity: What it is and how to assess it?".
