WHAT IS THIS?
==========
MQAssessor calculates several indicators that can be used to assess the discriminant validity and reliability of measurements.\
Social science researchers routinely report the discriminant validity and reliability of their measurements. However, existing structural equation modeling software does not automatically provide related values. Users are forced to do all their own calculations, but they often take a lot of effort and time to get the wrong values. MQAssessor is software that automates this process. MQAssessor is not finalized and will be explained in full in the working paper "Discrminant validity: What it is and how to assess it?".

HOW THIS IS WRITTEN?
================
The source code is written in python3. I do not have much programming experience, and perhaps from a software professional's point of view, I think there's plenty of room to make this code more efficient. Any comments or participation are welcome.
