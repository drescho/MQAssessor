WHAT IS THIS?
==========
MQAssessor calculates several indicators that can be used to assess the discriminant validity and reliability of measurements.\
Social science researchers routinely report the discriminant validity and reliability of their measurements. However, existing structural equation modeling software does not automatically provide related values. Users are forced to do all their own calculations, but they often take a lot of effort and time to get the wrong values. MQAssessor is software that automates this process. MQAssessor is not finalized and will be explained in full in the working paper "Discrminant validity: What it is and how to assess it?".
